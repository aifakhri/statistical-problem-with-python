# Simple Probability and Statistical Calculation with Python
## Introduction
This is a demonstration of how we could utilize Python to solve probability and statistical problems, covering a simple probability, conditional probability, continous variable, categorical variable, correlation coefficient and statistical testing problem.

For more detail about the description and explanation of the statistical problem, you could check my [medium story](https://medium.com/@zeitdeuter/a-practical-approach-to-solve-probability-and-statistical-problems-with-python-part-1-755c8a12f916).
